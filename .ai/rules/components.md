## Disable link/underline in StarterKit to avoid duplicate extensions

@tiptap/starter-kit v3 includes Link and Underline by default. This editor registers them explicitly too, which produced 'Duplicate extension names: [link, underline]' warnings and broke command registration -- e.g. editor.chain().setImage() threw 'setImage is not a function' so uploaded images never inserted. StarterKit.configure({ link: false, underline: false }) resolves it. Keep explicit Link/Underline extensions.
